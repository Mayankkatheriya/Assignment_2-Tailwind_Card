Document Setup:

The HTML document starts with standard tags for the HTML, head, and body sections.\
The title is designated as "TAILWIND-CARD," and an external stylesheet named "output.css" is linked.

Content Arrangement:

Inside the body, the content is centered horizontally and vertically using Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring it fills the entire screen height.

Card Container:

A div element contains the main content, applying the class "container w-2/5 p-2 bg-[#F7F6FA]." This class controls the width, padding, and background color of the product card.

Card Content:

Within the container, another div with the class "flex font-sans bg-white rounded-lg" serves as a flexible container for the product card layout.

Image Display:

Within the flex container, an image is placed within a div classed "flex-none w-48 relative." This div positions the image absolutely, sizes it, and adds styling.

Product Details:

After the image div, a form element with the class "flex-auto p-6" is employed to structure the product details section. It encompasses details, size choices, buttons, and a shipping note.

Details Presentation:

Inside the form, a section is constructed using classes like "flex," "flex-wrap," and various typography-related classes. This section showcases the product's name, price, and availability.

Size Choices:

Below the details, a section is arranged for choosing sizes. Each size is encompassed in a label, containing a concealed radio input and a div for presentation. Classes control the appearance based on selection.

Interaction Buttons:

Following this, there's a button section for both "Buy Now" and "Add to Bag" options. These buttons are styled using classes for padding, borders, and text colors.

Like Interaction:

The card features a button for "Like," styled with classes to determine its appearance. An SVG heart icon is included. A shipping note in a paragraph tag provides information about free shipping.
